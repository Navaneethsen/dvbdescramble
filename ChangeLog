0.2.1
    * Send the first PMT with the "only" flag (instead of "add"). Makes my
    CryptoWorks module work again.

0.2
    * Now ignores traffic from other Transport Connections, instead of trying
    to close them. This makes CAMs that were left in an unclean state work
    more reliably.

    * Introduces some basic support for descrambling more than one programme.
    (0.1 claimed to do so but didn't.)

    * A small glitch in the Link Layer (TPDU) data receive code made
    AlphaCrypt cards hang in the initialization protocol. Fixed.

    * I was able to hack on dvbdescramble on a machine with an AlphaCrypt CAM
    (thanks to Todor Neshev), so these should work. Irdeto and CryptoWorks
    modules are to follow.
